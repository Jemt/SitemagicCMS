       - TPLHeader, TPLContent, and TPLFooter now uses padding with 0.02px
         to disable margin collapse. This replaces overflow:auto which breaks
         text shadows or padding-top/bottom:1px which affects the visual result
		 on high-res displays supporting sub pixels.
       - Support for moving up TPLBottom behind content area has been improved
         so that TPLContent and TPLFooter no longer need to have position:relative set.
    - Sunrise
       - Removed styling no longer necessary.

         if a matching HTML file is found in the file system.

         integrate Google Analytics.
       - Fixed compatibility problem with image selection in TinyMCE
         on Chrome 58+: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=732123
       - Minor improvements to Fluid Grids.
    - SMDesigner:
       - Now allow Designer Definition to change the
         default CSS unit for dimension controls using e.g.
         SMDesigner.Helpers.DefaultDimensionUnit = "em";
         in the GetEditors callback.
       - Indentation Controls' Slider now assume the CSS unit passed
         from the GetEditors callback, and automatically assumes
         appropriate min/max/step-by values.
       - Designer now exposes an Update function allowing Designer
         Definition to programmatically trigger an update, forcing
         GetCss(..) to be triggered.
       - Combined controls (associated selector and slider) can now
         individually be hidden.
       - Fixed problem in GetDimensionCss(..) which returned "0" when no
         value as entered, but that doesn't work properly with calc(..) which
         requires a unit, so it now returns "0px" instead.
 - Templates
    - BaseGeneric
       - Footer, Page, and Snippets now uses the em CSS unit.

       - Made BaseGeneric itself load javascript enhancements.
       - Improvements and bug fixes.
    - Sunrise
       - Added support for setting the base font size on
         Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile under the General section.
         This makes it much easier making the site adjust to
         resolutions using the em CSS unit.
       - Added support for stretching header, menu, and footer
         across the entire page.
       - Added support for styling headings (h1-h6).

       - Added support for styling Fluid Grid Cards.

       - Added support for styling custom elements defined in templates using e.g.:
         <span class="SMDesignerElement" data-id="My element">Hello</span>
         For elements found only on certain pages, we need to tell the designer
         to always preserve styling, even when an element is not found on a given page.
         This is done simply by adding the data-preserve attribute with a value of true:
         <span class="SMDesignerElement" data-id="My element" data-preserve="true">Hello</span>
       - Added CSS Editor dialog for advanced CSS editing.

            header, menu links, and card header and footer.
          - Fixed problem with em unit on table cells and
            fieldset legends causing size to increase incorrectly.
          - Spacing between header and menu is now achieved using
            padding rather than margin.
          - Removed default padding left/right in menu.
          - Removed default padding top/bottom on TPLPage container
            making it difficult to position e.g. header or menu,
            often requiring use of negative margins.
          - Removed dublicate styling for table cells which today
            obtain font styling properly on recent versions of IE.
          - TPLContent and TPLFooter now has position:relative to make
            sure TPLBottom can move up behind them using negative margin.


Changelog 2017-05-07 #1
 - Templates
    - BaseGeneric:
       - Properly fixed problem with spacing between menu items
         that was previously fixed using CSS which unfortunately
         prevented the use of em units when the menu was styled.

         break points as an alternative to media queries to better
         support legacy IE, and an improvement to the footer allowing it
         to stick to the bottom of the window when window is higher than
         the content.

 - Extensions
    - SMContact:

          Spam Assassin and other filters to consider e-mails sent from
          contact forms to be spam.
        - Removed filename restrictions. Invalid characters
          are now simply removed from attachment filename.

    - SMDesigner:

         values saved that no longer has any associated controls.

         This may be used to support designer elements
         not defined on all pages.
    - SMPages:

      satisfy Spam Assassin and other spam filters.

       - Increased width of controls.
       - Designer definition: GetSelectors(..) is now invoked
         AFTER data has been loaded and CSS applied, allowing
         selectors to be adjusted based on changes made by the user.
         It also gets invoked every time the design is changed.
       - Designer definition: The label for editor controls
         may now consist of both an internal value and a
         display value separated by semicolon, allowing
         multiple controls with the same display value to hold values
         for multiple pages. Example:
         Background;PageBackground046f8e2c3ade408eab20aacf10fe7c01
         Background;PageBackground110cc0e318b045c5b613b03abd03b724.
         The Designer allows us to hide controls, making it possible
         to assicoate controls with specific pages, and hide all
         controls not related to the current page being manipulated.
       - Designer definition: GetEditors(..) may now return multiple
         root entries with the same display value if a unique ID is
         appended after a semicolon. Example:
         { "Test;T1": { .. }, "Test;T2": { .. } }.
       - Added support for combined Slider and Input control.
       - Replaced SMDesigner.Helpers.SyncType.UnidirectionalEqual (singular)
         with SMDesigner.Helpers.SyncType.UnidirectionalEquals (plural)
         while ensuring backward compatibility.
         Also introduced SMDesigner.Helpers.SyncType.UnidirectionalEqualsOrNull.
       - It is now possible to have a selector deep linking to a specific accordion
         by separating the section key from the accordion key using semicolon. Example:
         GetSelectors: function(eventArgs) { return { "Headings;Heading 1": "h1" }; }
       - Added support for sorting to Selector control. Top menu is now sorted.
       - Added support for GetDefaultSection(..) which can be used to return the
         initial section such as "Background" or "Menu", matching an index from an
         entry returned from GetSelectors(..).
       - Designer definition: Added support for OnDataLoaded(..) which fires
         after data has been loaded, allowing control manipulation based on
         saved values.
       - Minor fixes and improvements.
       - Dimension controls now consist of an input field,
         a CSS unit selector, and a value slider.

       - Data exchanged between client and server using a callback
         is now automatically encoded and decoded between Unicode
         and Latin1. The client can now send Unicode which Sitemagic
         converts to Latin1 for internal use, and finally converts
         back to Unicode before returning data to client.
         Unicode characters are represented by HEX entites in Latin1.
       - Data obtained using GetQueryValue(..), GetPostValue(..),

         from a callback.

      by using rem rather than em, and by that revert to
      the original font size applied to the document.
      This is also the default behaviour for a blank page
      where a font size of 1rem is equivalent to 1em.
    - All templates: Applied fix to all designer definitions
