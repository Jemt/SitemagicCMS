 - SQL tables needs to handle Unicode (8x capacity)

 - Make shop work without .htaccess support (/shop/).

 - Prevent shop settings from crashing if PSPI configuration files are not found in data/PSPI - copy config from JSShop or ignore PSPM.

 - QuickPay config should not have the "Cancel URL" option - that should be provided by JSShop/SMShop.
   However, this will require changes to PaymentServiceProviderInterface as a Cancel URL is not part of the interface.

 - Make it possible to configure PSPI logging from SMShop.

 - ReceiptPage is poorly conceived - we need more than a static "thank you" page.

 - Eliminate ShopEmail configuration - we do not want to "fake" a sender - use Sender from Config > Settings > SMTP instead!

 - Mail Editor should be WYSIWYG with support for adding dynamic attachments outside of the WYSIWYG editor.

 - Use Lazy Loader to load relevant modules rather than everything (SMShop/JSShop/JSShop.js)
